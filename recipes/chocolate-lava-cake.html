<h2>I'll be honest...</h2>

<p>There's only one place to go for the best chocolate lava cakes in the game. Here at Yackity's Snackity's
    we have tested all the most decadent and renowned desserts of the last generation's acclaim.

<p>YET, we have not tasted a rich indulgence that even attempts to rival the dominating control that this
    recipe has over us. It's quite the experience!
</p>

<p>The first bite is truly eye-opening, many at PeekYack's have struggled to recreate the same sensation.
    One such individual claimed that it was <strong>better than sex!</strong>

<p>Is that what we would tell you? No</p>
<p>We prefer to leave you to make your own mind up...</p>
