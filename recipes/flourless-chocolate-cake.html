<h1>Flourless Chocolate Cake</h1>

<a href="../index.html">Homepage</a>

<p>A flourless chocolate cake is perfect for someone who likes everything about cake...</p>
<p><em>except</em> for the actual cake part. Oh, <b>and</b> it's perfect for those gluten intolerants.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>By now you've caught onto how I'm running this operation...</li>
    <li>There's <b>no rhyme or reason</b> for these <em>recipes</em> (if you can even call them recipes).</li>
    <li>But hey, I'm learning, I'm having fun, and at the end of the day, if <b>we can't revel</b> in the 
    day to day, then, <b>what does that mean</b> for the prosaic platitudes of our life?</li>
    <li>Now, <strong>I have no idea what that guy said</strong> but, he's clearly on some existential
    over-intellectualisation...</li>
    <li><strong>Good for him?</strong> (I guess)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Yeah, I'm doing this so I can practice having another ordered list done.</li>
    <li>Minimal actual lines, but hella actual practice of ts.</li>
    <li>Maybe I'm becoming more like a coder, given that the consensus from The Odin Project was That
        coders are lazy. <em>HAHAHAAHA</em>
    </li>
</ol>
