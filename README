Pre-start goals:

Personal reflections:

40% through the Odin Project's 'Foundation Course.
I am feeling more confident with basic navigation in terminal and HTML basics.

It is making sense. Facing issues/bugs requires resilience to move through and not give up.

This is what everyone has to learn when they begin, however challenging.

I must frame the problem as what I will achieve or be capable of, otherwise, I am more likely to avoid solving the problem.
